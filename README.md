# Calculate-GPA-GUI
Program that lets the user input as many grades as they would like and once the user enters "-1", the program will calculate the users GPA based on grades entered. This is a basic program built in Java but I implemented a graphical user interface for the user to interact with.


Below is a picture of the program running after entering (A, B , C, -1)
